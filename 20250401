Scientist vs Engineer
  ㆍScientists use systematic methods to solve long-term problems
  ㆍEngineers use existing methods to solve current problems

Consensuses of the team:
(1) Select real-world issues given by industry;
(2) Try to introduce science into problem-solving process

The Objectives of this MOST sponsored Project
ㆍBring academic research and development capabilities into industry
ㆍCommercialize artificial intelligence technology, let the products enter the international market
ㆍ Let the world see Taiwan

Development process and phased goals
ㆍ Traffic flow analysis (2018.6~) Traffic flow analysis
ㆍVehicle queue analysis (2019.6~) Vehicle queue analysis
ㆍ Road network traffic signal control (2019~) Traffic signal control

物件偵測幾乎是所有領域相關研究的第一步 以深度學習為基礎的物件偵測是如何開始的?
常見的作法 : edge detection，希望為形成封閉曲線做准備，方便未來segmentation工作順利進行

設計的考量及策略
  ・必須是lightweight 效能必須快又准
  ・必須要能適用於cloud，local(ex.Notebook)，and edge (ex. Cell phone)
  ・先 survey 現存的 State-of-the-art 物件
設計物件偵測系統需考量的基本議題
  ㆍSome issues need to be considered 
    1、network architecture
    2、feature integration method 
    3、detection method
    4、loss function
    5、label assignment method
    6、training method
