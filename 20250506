Outline
ㆍNano Metals
ㆍSelf-powered Nanogenerator
ㆍMicroelectronics

Micro/Nano-Systems 
Micro/Nano: basic unit of measure is the micrometer or nanometerElectro: MEMS have electrical components
Mechanical: MEMS have mechanical parts
System: Refers to integration of components

Titanium Advantages
ㆍResistance to corrosion
ㆍHigh Strength
ㆍHigh melting point
ㆍNon-toxic
ㆍLow thermal expansion
ㆍExcellent fabrication possibilities
ㆍ Light in weight

Nano-Crystalline Superplasticity
ㆍFine grain superplasticity

Deformation of microcrystalline grains
ㆍGBS(Grain boundary sliding 晶界滑移)with accommodation processes
  ㆍGrain boundary migration
  ㆍRecrystallization
  ㆍDiffusion flow
  ㆍDislocation climb or glide
  ㆍGrain rotation
---->Superplasticity
Low Temperature or High Strain Rate Superplasticity(LTSP or HSRSP)

ㆍIn our extruded (ER=90:1)
AZ31 Magnesium Alloy

From Fine grained Metal into Amorphous Metallic Glasses(非晶質金屬玻璃)
ㆍMetallic Glasses : also known as metallic glass or glassy
ㆍ如鋼鐵般堅硬,如塑膠般多變
ㆍHigh strength
ㆍHigh hardness
ㆍHigh tensile elongation
・Absence of grain boundary (晶界) and segregation (循析)
---> 高熵合金(High-entropy alloys)

Amorphous Metal
Two hollow plastic tubes
ㆍOne block of metal is made of typical stainless steel
ㆍThe other is an amorphous metal
ㆍTwo identical stainless steel ball bearings are dropped
ㆍWhat happened?

Crystalline structure and amorphous structure
ㆍCrystalline solids contain defects (missing atoms) or dislocations
ㆍAmorphous metal, similar to glass, have a tightly-packed, yet random arrangement

Technology node
ㆍHistorically, the process node name referred to a number of different features of a transistor including the gate length
ㆍTechnology node is the width of line that can be processed with a minimum width. No longer length of transistor is critical at 22nm, 14nm, 10nm and 7 nm
ㆍIn general, smaller node = smaller transistors

Physical limit
ㆍWhen scaling reaches physical limit - paradigm shifts
  ㆍNew materials : MoS2.WS2、MoSe2、WSe2、Graphene?
  ㆍNew devices
  ㆍNew integration process
  ㆍNew packaging
  ㆍGreat opportunities
